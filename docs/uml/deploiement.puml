note bottom of KONG
  Kong Gateway Features:
  - API Key & JWT Authentication
  - Rate Limiting (100/min, 1000/hour)
  - CORS Configuration
  - Load Balancing (Cart Service)
  - Request/Response Transformation
  - Health Checks & Circuit Breaker
end note

note bottom of "Cart Service Cluster (Load Balanced)"
  Load Balancing Strategy:
  - Algorithm: least-connections
  - Health Checks: /health every 15s
  - Auto failover on unhealthy instances
  - Session stickiness via Redis
end note

note bottom of "Microservices Layer"
  Database per Service Pattern:
  - 9 PostgreSQL databases (isolated)
  - 1 Redis cache (shared by Cart instances)
  - In-memory saga state management
  - No direct database access between services
  - Saga orchestration for distributed transactions
end note

note right of "Saga Orchestrator :8008"
  Saga Orchestrator Features:
  - Synchronous orchestration pattern
  - State machine coordination
  - Automatic compensation on failures
  - Prometheus metrics integration
  - Timeout and retry mechanisms
  - In-memory state persistence
end note

note left of "Event-Driven Layer (Lab 7)"
  Event-Driven Architecture Features:
  - Event Sourcing with MongoDB persistence
  - CQRS with separate read/write models
  - Redis Streams for Pub/Sub messaging
  - Decoupled event consumers
  - Integration bridge with Lab 6
  - Separate monitoring stack
end note
